# 👋 Hi, I'm Rajat Bisht  

### 📊 **Aspiring Data Analyst | Insight Seeker | Problem Solver**  

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a data enthusiast passionate about uncovering insights, visualizing data, and solving complex problems. This is where I showcase my projects, skills, and learning journey in data analysis and beyond.  


## 🌟 **About Me**  

- Hey there! your friendly neighborhood data geek who believes that every dataset has a story waiting to be uncovered. 📖✨  
- While others binge-watch Netflix, I binge-analyze Netflix data. (Yes, I know how many horror movies were added last year. 🧟)  
- I’ve got a love-hate relationship with Python—loved it when it worked, hated it when it didn’t. 🐍💻  
- If data were a pizza, I’d slice it, dice it, and deliver insights faster than your local pizzeria. 🍕📊  
- My dream? To one day make my Tableau dashboards so good that they’re framed in the Louvre. 🎨📈
- Life motto: If life gives you lemons, turn them into pie charts. 🍋➡️📊

`Friendly Reminder` : **Crafted by me, polished by ChatGPT—because teamwork makes the dream work!**
